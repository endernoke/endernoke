# Hello World! üëã

I'm James Zheng, a high school student passionate about technology and currently diving into machine learning and artificial intelligence. I enjoy building software solutions to address social challenges and make a positive impact.

I strongly believe that the best way to learn something new is through hands-on experience, which is why I love creating projects to explore and develop my skills.
